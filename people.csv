For a couple months, I thought that meant learning to code. That took too long, and by March 2018, with no code tools and hacking stuff together, I launched District Flight Deals. In May 2019, I left my full-time job to see what I could do with District Flight Deals if I gave it more time. I kept my former employer as a marketing client of mine. Over 4,500 people have signed up since then, with customers traveling to Madagascar, Portugal, Los Angeles, Italy, and more. In the last couple months, I've talked to customers and have found what I think is the next step in helping travelers find cheap flights. It'll really distinguish District Flight Deals from other services, and I'm building it now.
